# Eater SAP-1 Improvements
Ben Eater released [a YouTube video series](https://eater.net/8bit) that works you through the process of building a simple 8-bit computer on a breadboard made with simple logic gates. It's a great learning experience if you are so interested.

Captured in this repository are various projects to extend and improve on the original SAP-1. The goal of these project is to build upon and reinforce what was learned with Ben Eater's original series.
